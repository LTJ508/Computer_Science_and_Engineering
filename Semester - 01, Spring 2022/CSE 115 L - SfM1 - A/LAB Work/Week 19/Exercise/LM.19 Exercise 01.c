/*
    Incorporate reading & writing to/from file in your project so that each time user starts the program,
    it doesn't read from user, instead it reads from a certain file and then show those to the user.
    Also, just before the program finishes, the program should store your array of structures in a file.
    Hint: combine the ideas in example 7 and 8 above to read & write to/from a file.
