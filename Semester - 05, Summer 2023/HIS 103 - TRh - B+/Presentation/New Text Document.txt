Following the failure of last-ditch talks, Yahya Khan declared martial law and ordered the army to crack down on Bengali political activities. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested on 26 March 1971 and flown to West Pakistan. He was initially a Bangladesh Forces Commander of BDF Sector 1 and later the Brigade Commander of Z Force. Ziaur Rahman, who was already preparing to revolt against the Pakistani government, was requested to announce the Declaration of Independence. However, his proclamation was criticized and rebuked by political leaders. Ziaur Rahman organized an infantry unit and was appointed commander of the first conventional brigade of the Bangladesh Forces, the "Z Force". With the Z Force, Ziaur Rahman gained a reputation for icy bravery and was awarded the Bir Uttom, the second-highest military honor by the Government of Bangladesh.
